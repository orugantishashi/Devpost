# 🌿 StudyBuddy – Pomodoro Timer

**Your simple and motivating productivity partner**

## 📌 Inspiration

We wanted to solve a common problem among students: losing focus while studying for long hours. The Pomodoro Technique is a simple but effective way to stay productive. We created **StudyBuddy** to help anyone manage study sessions, stay motivated with quotes, and take proper breaks.
